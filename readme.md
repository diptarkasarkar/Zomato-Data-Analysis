# 🍴 Zomato Dataset Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
Zomato is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company.  
This project explores and analyzes the **Zomato Dataset** using **SQL Server** to understand restaurant distribution, customer preferences, and business patterns.  

The dataset consists of **9,000+ rows** with attributes such as:  
- `RestaurantId`  
- `RestaurantName`  
- `City`  
- `Location`  
- `Cuisines`  
- `Rating`  
- `Votes`  
- `Currency`  
- `CountryCode`  
and many more...

## 🛠️ Steps in Data Exploration
During the **data exploration phase**, I worked on:  
- 🔍 Examining table schema (columns, data types, constraints)  
- 🔁 Checking and removing duplicate values in `RestaurantId`  
- 🧹 Removing irrelevant/unwanted columns  
- 🔗 Merging tables & adding `CountryName` column using `CountryCode` as a primary key  
- ✏️ Identifying and correcting mis-spelled city names  
- 📊 Counting restaurants with rolling/moving counts using window functions  
- 📉 Checking min, max, avg for `Votes`, `Rating`, and `Currency`  
- 🏷️ Creating new rating categories for better segmentation
